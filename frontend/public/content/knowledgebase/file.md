# Files

The Alice system supports various file types and provides a unique transcript feature that allows AI agents to understand and interact with the content of these files.

## File Interface

Files in the system are represented by the `FileReference` interface:

```typescript
export enum FileType {
    IMAGE = "image",
    AUDIO = "audio",
    VIDEO = "video",
    FILE = "file",
}

export interface FileReference extends BaseDataseObject {
    _id: string;
    filename: string;
    type: FileType;
    file_size: number;
    transcript?: MessageType;
    storage_path?: string;
    last_accessed?: Date;
}
```

Key properties:
- `filename`: The name of the file
- `type`: The category of the file (image, audio, video, or generic file)
- `file_size`: Size of the file in bytes
- `transcript`: A MessageType object containing a textual representation of the file's content
- `storage_path`: The location where the file is stored
- `last_accessed`: Timestamp of the last access to the file

## Transcript Feature

A unique aspect of the Alice system is that all file types, regardless of their nature, can have a string transcript associated with them. This transcript is stored as a `MessageType` object in the `transcript` property.

### Transcript Generation Process:

1. **Text Files**: For regular text files, the transcript is simply the content of the file.

2. **Images**: Image files undergo an image-to-text process, which may include:
   - Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text in images
   - Image description generation using AI models

3. **Audio Files**: Audio files are processed through a speech-to-text system to generate a transcript of the spoken content.

4. **Video Files**: Currently, video files do not have an automatic transcript generation process. This could be a future enhancement to the system.

5. **Other File Types**: For other file types, the system may generate a basic description or metadata summary as the transcript.

## Functionality

The transcript feature enables:

1. AI agents to "understand" the content of various file types
2. Improved searchability and context-awareness in conversations involving files
3. Accessibility features for users who may not be able to directly interact with certain file types

## User Interface Considerations

When working with files and transcripts in the UI, consider:

1. File type indicators (icons or labels)
2. Preview options for different file types
3. Display of file metadata (size, last accessed date)
4. An interface to view and potentially edit file transcripts
5. Integration with chat interfaces to seamlessly include file references and their transcripts in conversations

## Importance in AI Interactions

The transcript feature is crucial for AI agents. When a file is referenced in a conversation, the agent can access and utilize the transcript to:

1. Understand the content of images, audio, or other non-text files
2. Provide more context-aware responses
3. Perform tasks or answer questions based on the file's content

This feature significantly enhances the AI's ability to work with various types of media and files, making interactions more versatile and intelligent.
