# Task Responses

Task Responses represent the outcomes of executed tasks, including results, status information, and execution details.

## Task Response Structure

Each task response in the system is represented by the `TaskResponse` interface:

```typescript
export interface TaskResponse extends BaseDatabaseObject {
    _id?: string;
    task_name: string;
    task_id: string;
    task_description: string;
    status: 'pending' | 'complete' | 'failed';
    result_code: number;
    task_outputs?: string;
    references?: References;
    task_inputs?: { [key: string]: any };
    result_diagnostic?: string;
    usage_metrics?: { [key: string]: any };
    execution_history?: { [key: string]: any }[];
}
```

Key properties:
- `task_name` and `task_id`: Identify the associated task
- `status`: Indicates the current state of the task execution
- `result_code`: A numeric code representing the outcome
- `task_outputs`: The main output or result of the task
- `task_inputs`: The inputs provided to the task
- `result_diagnostic`: Additional information about the task execution
- `usage_metrics`: Performance or resource usage data
- `execution_history`: Detailed log of the task execution process

## Functionality

In the frontend, task responses are used to:

1. Display the results of executed tasks
2. Track the status and progress of ongoing tasks
3. Provide detailed information about task execution for debugging or analysis
4. Link task results to other components (e.g., including results in chat messages)

## User Interface Considerations

When designing interfaces for task responses, consider:

1. Clear status indicators (pending, complete, failed)
2. Formatted display of task outputs based on the type of data
3. Collapsible sections for detailed execution history or diagnostics
4. Integration with chat interfaces for seamless inclusion of task results in conversations
5. Filtering and sorting options for managing multiple task responses
