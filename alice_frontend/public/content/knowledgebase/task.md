# Tasks

Tasks in Alice represent specific operations or workflows that can be executed by agents or triggered within chats. They encompass a wide range of functionalities, from simple API calls to complex multi-step processes.

## Task Types

The Alice system supports various task types, each designed for specific purposes:

```typescript
export type TaskType = "APITask" | "PromptAgentTask" | "CheckTask" | "CodeGenerationLLMTask" | "CodeExecutionLLMTask" | "Workflow" | "EmbeddingTask" | "GenerateImageTask" | "TextToSpeechTask" | "WebScrapeBeautifulSoupTask";
```

These task types cover a broad spectrum of functionalities, including search operations, code generation and execution, text-to-speech conversion, and more. The simplest of these are the:
- `API tasks`: Tasks that use non-model APIs. Examples include the Google, Wikipidia, Arxiv, Exa and Reddit search tasks. 
- `Prompt agent tasks`: Tasks that use prompts and agents. Base functionality is generating an LLM response to a prompt. This task has some 'child' tasks:
  - `CheckTask`: Task structured to compare the output generated by the agent with the strings in exit_code_response_map. Allows for easy ways to classify things. For example "Respond with WRONG if the answer is flawed, and CORRECT if the answer makes sense" could be used as a gate to know what task to deploy next. 
  - `CodeExecutionLLMTask`: Task takes the input message, retrieves all code blocks and executes them in a docker container
  - `CodeGenerationLLMTask`: Task that ensure the output generated contains at least one codeblock, or fails. 
- Other agent tasks: Sibling task classes to the prompt agent task, that don't use a prompt to template the task. 
  - `Text-to-speech task`: In this case, it uses the agent to determine which model to use for the generation, and returns a file with the speech created. 
  - `WebScrapeBeautifulSoupTask`: Takes a URL, retrieves it, task a string sample of the html to show an agent who creates the selectors for BeautifulSoup parsing of the content. 
  - `GenerateImageTask`: Takes an image prompt and uses the agent's img_gen model to generate an image based on it. 
  - `EmbeddingTask`: Takes a string and the agent's embeddings model to generate the vector embeddings for the text provided. 
- `Workflow`: The simplest a most complex task. Simple because all it does is run other tasks. Complex because the options are endless. Main difference is they have a tasks_end_code_routing to map the logic path and require a start_task to begin it. 

## Task Structure

Each task in the system is represented by the `AliceTask` interface:

```typescript
export interface AliceTask extends BaseDataseObject {
  _id?: string;
  task_name: string;
  task_description: string;
  task_type: TaskType;
  input_variables: FunctionParameters | null;
  exit_codes: { [key: string]: string };
  recursive: boolean;
  templates: { [key: string]: Prompt | null };
  tasks: { [key: string]: AliceTask };
  valid_languages: string[];
  timeout: number | null;
  prompts_to_add: { [key: string]: Prompt } | null;
  exit_code_response_map: { [key: string]: number } | null;
  start_task?: string | null;
  required_apis?: ApiType[] | null;
  model_id: AliceModel | null;
  task_selection_method?: CallableFunction | null;
  tasks_end_code_routing?: TasksEndCodeRouting | null;
  max_attempts?: number;
  agent?: AliceAgent | null;
  human_input?: boolean;
  api_engine?: APIEngine | null;
}
```

Key properties:
- `task_name` and `task_description`: Identify and describe the task
- `task_type`: Specifies the category of the task
- `input_variables`: Defines the expected inputs for the task
- `exit_codes`: Possible outcomes of the task execution
- `tasks`: Subtasks for complex workflows
- `model_id`: The AI model used for this task (if applicable)
- `agent`: The agent assigned to execute this task (if applicable)

## Task Functionality

In the frontend, tasks provide the following functionality:

1. **Task Creation and Editing**: Users can create new tasks or edit existing ones, configuring all relevant properties.

2. **Task Execution**: Tasks can be executed individually or as part of a chat conversation.

3. **Workflow Management**: Complex tasks (Workflow type) can be created by combining multiple subtasks.

4. **Integration with APIs and Models**: Tasks can be configured to use specific APIs and AI models.

5. **Error Handling and Retries**: The `max_attempts` property allows for automatic retries in case of failures.

## Task Routing

The `tasks_end_code_routing` property allows workflows to perform complex decision-making based on task outcomes:

```typescript
export type RouteMapTuple = [string | null, boolean];
export type RouteMap = { [key: number]: RouteMapTuple };
export type TasksEndCodeRouting = { [key: string]: RouteMap };
```

This structure enables the creation of dynamic workflows where the next step is determined by the outcome of the current task.
