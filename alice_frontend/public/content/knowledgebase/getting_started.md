# Getting Started with Alice

Welcome to Alice! This guide will help you set up and start using the Alice project. Alice is a powerful AI-driven platform with a React-based frontend that interacts with Backend and Workflow containers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git (for version control)

## Setting Up the Frontend

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/alice-frontend.git
   cd alice-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:4000` by default.

## Exploring Alice

Once you have the frontend running, you can start exploring Alice's features:

1. **Database Management**: Navigate to the Database section to view, create, and edit various entities like Agents, Models, Prompts, and Tasks.

2. **Task Execution**: Go to the Task Execution interface to create and run different types of tasks. You can view and analyze task results here.

3. **Chat Completions**: Use the Chat interface to start conversations with AI agents and integrate task results into your chats.

4. **User Management**: Set up your user profile and manage your settings in the User Settings section.

## Key Concepts

To get the most out of Alice, familiarize yourself with these key concepts:

1. **Agents**: AI entities with specific capabilities. Learn more in the [Agent documentation](/knowledgebase/agent).

2. **Tasks**: Predefined operations that Agents can perform. There are various types of tasks, each with its own configuration.

3. **Models**: The underlying AI models that power Alice's capabilities.

4. **Prompts**: Carefully crafted instructions that guide the AI's behavior.

5. **APIs**: External services that Alice can interact with to extend its capabilities.

## Next Steps

1. Try creating your first Agent in the Database section.
2. Set up a simple Task and execute it.
3. Start a chat conversation and see how you can integrate task results.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console for any error messages.
2. Ensure all required services (Backend and Workflow containers) are running.
3. Verify your API configurations in the User Settings.
